# Simple helper scripts for my Geocaching needs #

The scripts here provide a helping hand when solving some mystery-cache riddles. None of the scripts solve the whole riddle and doesn’t produce the final cooordinates of the cache. The scripts only make the solving easier by printing all possible options (brute-force).

If you are an owner of any of the geocache referenced and you don’t agree with such a script being publicly available here at Github, please contact me at driezasson@me.com.
